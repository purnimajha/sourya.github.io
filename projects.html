<p> I wrote this script to scrape results from the Semester Results page 
    of our institute and sort them rankwise (since the institute does not 
    provide rankwise results any more).

<p> This was supposed to be a clone of the templating language Jinja. I wrote 
    this because it was mentioned somewhere that it is a rite of passage 
    for Python programmers to write one's own implementation of a templating 
    language. The code sucks, by the way, and I hope to rewrite it someday.
